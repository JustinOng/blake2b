# blake2b
This is a partial implementation of the blake2b algorithm used in the mining of Siacoin.

This has been simulated with Icarus Verilog (*_list are the list of relevant files for each *_test file).

This has also been synthesised with Quartus Prime 16 targeting the EP4CE6 Cyclone IV FPGA, requiring around 51k logic elements (no where close to fitting on the EP4CE6).
